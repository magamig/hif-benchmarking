# UAL-CVPR2020
"Unsupervised Adaptation Learning for Hyperspectral Imagery Super-resolution" 

The main process of the proposed UAL framework contains two steps, first is use the "Train_FusionModel.py" to train the Fusionmodel. Second, we urilize the pre-trained Fusionmodel to provide the initial input of the adaptor network and we train the adaptor under unsupervised mode to generate the specific reconstructed HR HSI.
